        type: "Poster"
        projectdesc: "Matthew contributed to the development of a research faculty search engine for UVA’s Data Analytics Center. 
        He designed and implemented a Flask-based web application that scrapes UVA department sites and integrates NIH RePORTER data to compile faculty profiles, which are then embedded using a transformer model and indexed with FAISS for semantic search.
        The tool enables users to filter and query for faculty aligned with DAC expertise and NIH domains, significantly improving upon previous manual workflows. Matthew also led backend deployment using Docker, Nginx, and Gunicorn, 
        and collaborated with DAC staff to validate functionality and guide iterative refinement."
