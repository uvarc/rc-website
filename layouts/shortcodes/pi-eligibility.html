<a>All UVA faculty are eligible to serve as PI and request access to RC services (e.g. storage & HPC allocations, virtual machines, microservices) for their research group. Postdocs and staff are encouraged to use an allocation provided by a faculty sponsor, although they may request their own allocation pending departmental or RC approval. Graduate and undergraduate students are not permitted to request allocationsâ€”this must be done by their faculty advisor[s]. Similarly, researchers with sponsored accounts are not eligible to request allocations, but they may use the HPC or storage as members of a Grouper account controlled by an eligible faculty.</a>
