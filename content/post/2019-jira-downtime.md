The JIRA ticketing system will be taken offline on <strong>Friday, December 13 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.</strong> while our system engineers continue the process of migrating the ticketing system from a local environment to the cloud. Please avoid submitting requests during this period if possible. Although moving to a cloud-based ticketing system will improve the speed and efficiency of our customer service in the long run, in the short-term it may cause disruptions for some users.
If you are unable to log in to JIRA after the migration is completed, you will need to change your password using your UVA e-mail address. Please note: Eservices passwords will not work in JIRA cloud.
