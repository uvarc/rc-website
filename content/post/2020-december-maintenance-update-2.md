In order to expedite users' access to the system, Rivanna will be returned to service in 2 separate phases:

- During phase 1, which is expected to be completed in fewer than 72 hours from now, the standard, GPU, largemem, and front-end nodes will be reactivated.
- Rivanna's parallel nodes will be released in phase 2 which should be finished within the 72-hour timeframe.
