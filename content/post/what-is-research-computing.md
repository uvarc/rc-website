UVA Research Computing (RC) is a new program that aims to support computational biomedical research by providing advanced cyberinfrastructure and expertise in data analysis at scale. Our mission is to foster a culture of computational thinking and promote interdisciplinary collaboration in various data-driven research domains. We offer services related to high performance computing, cloud architecture, scientific programming and big data solutions. We also aim to promote computationally intensive research at UVA through collaborative efforts such as UVA's own CADRE (Computation And Data Resource Exchange) and XSEDE (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment).

One of our driving philosophies is that researchers already have medical and scientific expertise, and should not have to become computing experts on top of that. To that end, our approach is service- and project-driven. 
Rather than approach your research with a specific technology or platform in mind beforehand, we want to understand your research goals and how computational support will help you get there.
