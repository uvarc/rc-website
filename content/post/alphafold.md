We are pleased to announce that AlphaFold is now available on Rivanna! Here are some of our user's first few protein structure prediction calculations on Rivanna.

Simple ZFc protein: Similar results for AlphaFold (brown) and I-TASSER (blue). (This figure was created with the [RCSB Pairwise Structure Alignment tool](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/policies#References).)

146PduD-linker-ZFc protein: AlphaFold's (left) superior ability to predict secondary structure, a β-sheet in its green-yellow region, whereas I-TASSER (right) is not sufficiently refined to feature any β-strands. (This figure was created with [NGL Viewer](https://nglviewer.org/#cite).)
