The Scholarsâ€™ Lab, the UVA Library Digital Humanities Center (DHC), and the <strong>Data Analytics Center (DAC)</strong> are delighted to announce a new fellowship opportunity.



The 2025 Data Analytics Center-Digital Humanities Center Fellowship is open for proposals from UVA faculty and graduate students. This is an experimental iteration encouraging the use of <strong>high-performance computing resources</strong> in the humanities, as well as identifying digital humanities research and teaching that could benefit from support from DHC and DAC. Possible projects might utilize AI, gaming platforms, imaging tools, geospatial technologies, use of new tools, and more.


The awarded team will consist of one faculty and one graduate student collaborating on humanities research in the University of Virginia. For more information, see the complete [CFP](https://virginia.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3ac105f4d87dddbd34542ab41&id=0f717c11d5&e=a4bf003185). Applications are due April 1, 2025. We highly recommend all interested applicants (either individually or as a team) email us (lb-dac-dhc-fellowship@virginia.edu) to discuss ideas, budget possibilities, and proposed collaborations.
