{{< alert-green >}}The Ivy Virtual Machines (VMs) and high security zone HPC system will be down for storage maintenance on <strong>Tuesday, Oct 15, 2024</strong>, beginning at 6 a.m.  

The system is expected to return to full service by 6 a.m. on <strong>Wednesday, Oct 16..</strong>{{< /alert-green >}}


## IMPORTANT MAINTENANCE NOTES

During the maintenance all VMs will be down as well as the UVA Ivy Data Transfer Node (DTN) and Globus services. The High-Security HPC cluster will also be unavailable for all job scheduling and viewing. 

If you have any questions about the upcoming Ivy system maintenance, you may contact our [user services team](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/support/). 

### Ivy Central Storage transition to HSZ Research Standard 

To transition from old storage hardware, we have retired the Ivy Central Storage and replaced it with the new High Security Zone Research Standard storage. There will be new filesystem locations for Ivy Linux VMs and updated shortcuts on Windows VMs. 

Filesystem locations can be found on the RC website [Research Data Storage Page](https://rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/storage/).
