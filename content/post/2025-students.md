Where next-gen technology meets real mentorship, UVA Research Computing is powering more than research — it's empowering careers. Each semester, a small cohort of [student workers](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/about/students/) joins Research Computing, a team within UVA Information Technology Services, to contribute to essential tools, systems, and services that support research across the University.

The program was designed to create a sustainable, scalable student workforce that enhances Research Computing’s operational efficiency and strengthens its service and support offerings.

In the interviews below, three student workers reflect on how hands-on projects, mentorship, and real-world challenges helped them grow not only in their technical skills but also as communicators, collaborators, and emerging professionals.

In turn, their contributions are helping shape the future of research computing at UVA — from building practical tools and improving internal processes to making resources more accessible for the broader research community.

Meet the students — each with a personal story of growth, discovery, and meaningful contribution to Research Computing:

## Jennifer Vo

### Building Confidence, Community, and a Career in Research Computing

Jennifer blended technical development with community outreach, improving the Research Computing Learning site and representing the team at national workshops. Her work helped streamline internal processes and launched her into a full-time role after graduation.
