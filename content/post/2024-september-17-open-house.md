UPDATE: The Research Computing Open House was held on a blustery, rainy day, but the spirits of the staff and attendees were not dampened.  Turnout was above expectations despite the wet weather.  Attendees enjoyed the buffet and their interactions with RC staff.  

The winners of the random-drawing prizes were
* Maria Luana Morais, SOM
* Matt Panzer, SEAS
* Artun Duransoy, SEAS
