The Data Analytics Center is UVA's new hub for the management and analysis of your large research data. Need help with your computational research? DAC staff specialize in key domain areas such as image processing, text analysis, bioinformatics, computational chemistry and physics, neural networks, and more. And because the DAC team is located within Research Computing, they can assist in getting your workflows running on the University’s high-performance cluster or secure data system. They can answer your basic computational questions or, through funded engagements, be embedded in your projects.

Big data doesn’t have to be a big deal. Learn how DAC can assist with your computational research – schedule an initial consultation with one of their data analysts by [submitting a consultation request.](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/form/support-request/?category=Data%20Analytics) Information on DAC's full range of services is available on the [DAC webpage.](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/service/dac/)
