**What:** Join us for a first of its kind Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC) event, co-hosted by the Northeast, Purdue, and Virginia WHPC chapters to engage in discussions about current challenges and opportunities for fostering a more diverse and inclusive WHPC community. Our panelists will provide an overview of their chapters’ community activities and offer insights into navigating hurdles and fostering professional growth within HPC. 

The format for this event will be a brief presentation by the hosts followed by theme-focused breakout rooms where participants will be invited to share their experience and personal perspective.

Please join us for this critical dialogue!
