<strong>Important Dates</strong>
<strong>New Submission Date: March 31, 2025</strong>
<strong>UVA RC Exhibition: April 23, 2025</strong>:   

`
<strong>Everyone is welcome to attend the Exhibition on April 23rd, at the Newcomb Hall Ballroom, 10:00am - 2:00pm</strong>. 


Our Exhibition includes a judged poster competition with travel awards presented to the winning finalists. If you have used Research Computing resources to support your research, we invite you to submit a poster! Posters should reflect how you have used these resources to support your research. 

Three finalists will be recognized with a travel award that can be used for professional travel such as conferences, meetings of professional associations, or other travel related to your research.  

First Place: $3,000 travel voucher 

Second Place: $2,000 travel voucher 

Third Place: $1,000 travel voucher 

Although all researchers using Research Computing resources are invited to participate, the lead author must be someone other than a faculty member to be eligible for an award. Resources used may include systems, such as Rivanna, Afton, or Ivy, as well as collaboration with Research Computing staff.  
 


Submit your poster PDF on the [Poster Competition Submission Form](https://virginia.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b918ecff2df30f32775065906&id=26c2154183&e=7a592fe565) on or before March 31st in one of the following categories: Biological and Health Sciences, Physical and Health Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, or Other. Participants must print their poster for the event day.  
 

Judging Information 

The judges will review the PDFs prior to the event to select the finalists for the awards. During the event, judges will visit your poster and ask questions related to your research. Prizes will be awarded at the end of the Exhibition.  

 
To select our finalists, judges will consider the following criteria: 

How much did using RC resources contribute to the outcome of the research presented? 

How well is the use of RC resources communicated on the poster? 

How well is the importance of this scientific investigation communicated? 

 

We look forward to your participation in this event! Please contact rc-events@virginia.edu with questions.
