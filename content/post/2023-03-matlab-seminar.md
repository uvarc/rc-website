Medical images come from multiple sources such as MRI, CT, X-ray, ultrasound, and PET. Analysis of these images requires a comprehensive environment for data access, visualization, processing, and algorithm development. The main challenge is to extract clinically meaningful information based on advanced techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). To achieve this, one needs to clean, segment, register, and label a large collection of images. For the AI analysis, there are many more challenges such as iteratively adjusting AI models or learning parameters. MATLAB provides tools such as Medical Imaging Toolbox and Deep Learning Toolbox and algorithms for end-to-end medical image analysis and AI workflow.
