UVA Research Computing, including the Data Analytics Center and the Digital Technology Core, is proud to announce our **Annual Research Computing Exhibition, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Tuesday, April 21, at the School of Data Science**.

Our Exhibition includes a judged poster competition, with travel awards presented to select finalists. **If you have used Research Computing resources to support your research, we invite you to submit a poster.**
 
Selected finalists will be recognized with a travel award that can be used for professional travel such as conferences, meetings of professional associations, or other travel related to your research.
- First Place: **$3,000 travel voucher**
- Second Place: **$2,000 travel voucher**
- Third Place: **$1,000 travel voucher**

Posters should reflect how you have used Research Computing resources to support your research, including collaboration with Research Computing staff or utilization of systems, such as Rivanna, Afton, or Ivy.

Although all researchers using RC resources are invited to participate, **the lead author must be someone other than a faculty member to be eligible for an award**.
