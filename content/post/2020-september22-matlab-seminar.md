## Overview

Deep learning can achieve humanlike accuracy at tasks such as naming objects in a scene or recognizing optimal paths in an environment.  Sometimes it can even exceed human performance, recognizing non-obvious patterns in image or signal data.

In this new neuroscience seminar, we’ll illustrate the fundamentals of deep learning in MATLAB.  Using an age-labeled BIDS dataset from the OpenNeuro repository, we’ll train a deep network to accurately classify the age range of normalized human MRI brain images, not obviously discernible by human inspection.

## Highlights

Along the way, participants will learn many aspects of the deep learning workflow:

 * Load and manage large sets of images
 * Import pre-trained models such as ResNet
 * Set up transfer learning via network modification
 * Get to network training quickly with apps for preprocessing and augmenting training image data
 * Configure network training parameters
 * Validation of convergence during deep model training
 * Interoperability with open source deep learning frameworks (i.e.,TensorFlow-Keras, Caffe, PyTorch, etc.,) using ONNX
 * Accelerate algorithms on NVIDIA® GPUs, cloud, and datacenter resources without specialized programming.
