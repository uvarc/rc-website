<p class=lead>In addition to providing <a href="/education/workshops/"> free, in-person workshop training</a>, 
UVA Research Computing staff teach for-credit courses. Below is a selection of courses that members of our group have taught, 
co-taught or provided guest lectures:</p>

# BIMS 8382: Introduction to Biomedical Data Science

**Spring 2017, Spring 2018**

This course introduces methods, tools, and software for reproducibly managing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale biomedical data. Specifically, the course introduces the R statistical computing environment and packages for manipulating and visualizing high-dimensional data, covers strategies for reproducible research, and culminates with analysis of data from a real RNA-seq experiment using R and Bioconductor packages.
