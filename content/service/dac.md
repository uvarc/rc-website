Our team consists of experts with diverse backgrounds, offering a wealth of knowledge and experience in various domains, including bioinformatics, AI and machine learning, drug discovery, statistical analysis, image processing, high-performance computing, and data management and compliance, among others.  Our services and resources range from embedding one of our team members in your project and creating custom workflows to leasing storage and purchasing time on our high-performance cluster.  These services are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing us to support researchers across a wide range of disciplines and research questions, and can vary in scope, rate, and time-commitment from DAC team members. PIs may budget for DAC support in their grants and DAC members can be listed as key personnel. 

We are committed to enhancing the quality and impact of research across Grounds by providing exceptional data analytics support using UVA HPC platforms.  If you would like to learn more about how the DAC can assist with your project, or if you have specific needs or questions, please contact us at RC-DAC@virginia.edu.

# How to Get Started with DAC Support
If you would like DAC assistance with a project, please contact us at RC-DAC@virginia.edu. Generally, we will start with a consultation to discuss project feasibility.  If your project is approved and meets the basic or in-depth collaboration requirements, a DAC team member will schedule a meeting to discuss staff effort and deliverables.  For an in-depth collaboration, we will create a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) that outlines the support researchers can expect from the DAC, detailing the project scope, budget, technical tasks to be completed, timeline, team member percent effort, and the deliverables to be provided at the end of the project. The SOW ensures all parties have a mutual understanding of the project's objectives and the level of support that will be offered. 

<!--
To ensure that DAC support is included in your upcoming grant proposal, we recommend that you schedule a consultation to explore the ways in which we can assist you.
