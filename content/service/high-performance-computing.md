<p class=lead>Research Computing supports all UVA researchers who are interested in writing code to address their scientific inquiries. Whether these programming tasks are implemented interactively, in a series of scripts or as an open-source software package, services are available to provide guidance and enable collaborative development. RC has specific expertise in object-oriented programming in <b>Matlab</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>Python</b>.</p>

Examples of service areas include:

- Collaborating on package development
- Reviewing and debugging code
- Preparing scripts to automate or expedite tasks
- Developing web interfaces for interactive data exploration
- Advising on integration of existing software tools

- - -

<p class=lead>UVA has four local computational facilities available to researchers: <b>Rivanna</b>, <b>Afton</b>, <b>Rio</b> and <b>Ivy</b>. Depending upon your use case, privacy requirements, and the application(s) you need to run, we can help you create an account and start processing your data.</p>

    <p class="card-text">
Rio is one of the recent University of Virginiaâ€™s High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, specifically designed for the processing and analysis of controlled-access and highly sensitive data. Currenlty, Rio consists of 39 HPC nodes, each equipped with 375 GB of RAM and offering a combined total of 1,560 x86 64-bit compute cores. Researchers can use Rio to process and store sensitive data with the confidence that the environment is secure and meets HIPAA and FERPA requirements.
