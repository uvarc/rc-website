The DTC is a one stop shop for researchers conducting experiments with modern wearables, smartwatches, smartphones, and IoT devices. The DTC exists to make it faster, easier, and more affordable to use modern consumer devices in research. Whether you're just getting started with devices/apps in your research or have a long track record, the DTC can meet you where you're at and provide the services you need.

# What can the Digital Technology Core do for me?
The DTC understands different teams have different needs. We are open to working with you in the way that is best for you. Below is a list of some of the ways we've worked with teams in the past. If one of these sound like what you're looking for please contact us.
* Create smartphone apps to collect data, share content, and intervene to change behavior
* Collect and act on data from multiple devices (e.g., Oura ring, Whoop band, and Smartphone)
* Utilize a secure cloud where you can safely send data from IoT devices and wearables in real time
* Brainstorm ideas within the digital technology space (we love to help you formulate your ideas)

# Isn't building an app time consuming and expensive?
Traditionally yes, but the DTC offers a model that we call "hosted" apps that are faster and more affordable than a traditional app. A "hosted" app is somewhere between building an app from scratch and using someone else's app. The hosted approach has many benefits for you:
* Maintenance costs (e.g., bug fixes) are shared by all DTC "hosted" apps
* New features added by the DTC will be immediately available to you for free
* You are able to avoid all app store reviews and publication requirements
* Updates to your "hosted" app can be released in a matter of minutes
* Your "hosted" app will automatically work natively in both iOS and Android

# Can I collect data from device _____?
Probably, most modern wearable device support integration via web APIs. If a device you want to work with provides API integration (e.g., Apple Watch, Android Wear, Whoop, Oura, BioStrap, FitBit) then we can easily add it to our eco-system (if we haven't already). If you aren't sure if we support your device contact us and ask.

# What happens to data you collect for me?
All data collected by the Digital Technology Core ends up in the DTC cloud. To access your data you simply need to create an account with the DTC and then you can download your data at any time. The data we collect for you is owned by you and governed by your IRB.

# What does it cost to work with the Digital Technology Core?
The exact cost for a project is determined on a per-project basis, though in general costs come from two sources:
1. Paying to add new functionality (this is charged as hours of developer time)
2. Paying to use existing functionality (this is charged monthly to defer maintenance costs)

# Do you offer funding grants?
Yes, if you have a research idea but don't yet have grant money, you can apply for DTC funding. We call thse awards "seed "grants". The goal of DTC seed grants is to support you en-route to a larger and more competitive research grant. As such, awards are typically around $10,000, which covers adding one new feature to the DTC ecosystem and completing a study with participants. If you want to apply for a seed grant we encourage you to talk with us first. In our initial conversation we can let you know if your proposal is something the DTC could fund. For eligibility criteria and application template see [DTC seed grants](/service/dtc/grants).

# How do I include the DTC in my grant budget?
PIs may budget for DTC support in their grants.  To ensure that DTC support is included in your upcoming grant proposal, we recommend that you schedule a consultation to explore the ways in which we can assist you.  Our services and resources range from embedding one of our team members in your project to providing access to our existing software infrastructure for mobile data collection.

# Ready to get started?
Contact us today using any of the methods on our [contact page](/service/dtc/contact). If you still aren't sure if the DTC can help you, please reach out anyways. Tech jargon can be hard to follow, and sometimes all you need is to talk it through.
