We offer a variety of services, most of which are provided at no charge to the researcher. 


# Training and Technical Support {#tier-1-training-technical-support}

Research Computing provides training for the use of our systems.  The training includes onboarding, [introductory sessions](/education/workshops/#new-to-high-performance-computing), and [computational workshops](/education/workshops). We also provide customized group trainings which you can request [here](/form/support-request/). 

We provide technical support to researchers by assisting with system access issues and troubleshooting computational problems on our systems.  To receive online technical support, researchers can <a href="/form/support-request/?category=Data%20Analytics">submit a ticket</a>.  We also have weekly <a href="/support/#office-hours"> virtual office hours</a> where researchers can speak to Research Computing staff.  Training and Technical Support are provided at no charge.

We provide guidance and recommend best practices on our systems in service areas such as data storage and code improvement, and can also discuss project feasibility. While a consultation does not include any hands-on work by Research Computing personnel, the outcome of a consultation may include a recommendation for a hands-on collaboration.  Consultations are provided at no charge.

# Collaborations: Expertise and Custom Solutions

<img src="/images/dac_tiers_collaboration.jpg" style="float:right;" class="project-inset" />

Research Computing has a team of computational experts specializing in a variety of fields, such as High-Performance Computing (HPC), bioinformatics, artificial intelligence (AI), image processing, and more. Whether you need assistance with project analysis or grant-related tasks, our experts are ready to collaborate and develop tailor-made solutions for your research needs.

## Basic Collaborations
Our Basic Collaborations are designed for tasks that do not require significant time commitment from our team. For example, we may leverage our expertise to efficiently debug codes or rewrite scripts that parallelize your job. Typically, these collaborations involve less than 20 hours of work, with no more than 8 hours of effort required in any given week. We are pleased to offer this service at no charge to the researchers.

## In-Depth Collaborations
We also offer comprehensive collaboration services, where our experts thoroughly examine your data, suggest appropriate analyses, streamline workflows, or create custom programs for data analysis. In special cases, we may design architectures to facilitate your workflows. These tailored solutions typically involve over 20 hours of effort from our team members. Because of the extensive time and specialized expertise required, we charge a fee depending on the skills and efforts required.
