<p class=lead>UVA Research Computing (RC) can help with your bioinformatics project.</p>

<hr size=1 style="padding-bottom:10px;" />

# Next-generation sequence data analysis

RC staff can help you start to use popular bioinformatics software for functions such as

* Genome assembly, reference-based and/or de-novo
* Whole-Genome/Exome sequence analysis for variant calling/annotation
* RNA-Seq data analysis to quantify, discover and profile RNAs
* Mircobiome data analysis, including 16S rRNA surveys, OTU clustering, microbial profiling, taxonomic and functional analysis from whole shotgun metagenomic/metatranscriptomic datasets
* Epigenetic analysis from BSAS/ChIP-Seq/ATAC-Seq

# Computing Platforms

UVA has three computing facilities available to researchers: _Rivanna_ and _Afton_, for non-sensitive data, and _Ivy_, for sensitive data. In addition, cloud-based services offer a computing environment for running flexible, scalable on-demand applications. RC can work with your team to determine the computing platform best suited for your research project.

    <p class="card-text">
	We can explore the possibility of using cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) for your bioinformatics analysis and data storage. For certain applications, the 'elasticity' of cloud computing may prove beneficial for saving time and reducing costs of data analysis and sharing. The RC team is available for consultation on your project needs.
