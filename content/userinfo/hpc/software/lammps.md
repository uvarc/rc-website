# Description
LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is a molecular-dynamics code. The code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new functionality. LAMMPS can run on a single core but is designed to be highly efficient running on a large number of cores in parallel using message-passing techniques and a spatial decomposition of the simulation domain.  It solves systems ranging from single atoms through polymers and proteins to rigid collections of particles.  A variety of force fields is supported.

Local support is not available.  LAMMPS has documentation and tutorials at its Website.   It has a large and active community of users; to search or join the mailing list see the instructions here.

**Software Category:** {{% module-category %}}

For detailed information, visit the [{{% software-name %}} website]({{< module-homepage >}}).

# Available Versions
To find the available versions and learn how to load them, run:
```
module spider {{% module-name %}}
```

The output of the command shows the available {{% software-name %}} module versions.

For detailed information about a particular {{% software-name %}} module, including how to load the module, run the `module spider` command with the module's full version label. __For example__:
```
module spider {{% module-firstversion %}}
```

Users may build their own versions of LAMMPS if they wish to use a different compiler and MPI combination, or to choose individual optional packages.  Instructions are available at the [LAMMPS Getting Started"](http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Build.html) page.

# Example Slurm script
To run the system version of LAMMPS, a script similar to the following can be used.  LAMMPS has many options so only the most basic is shown.
