# Overview
Python is an integrated technical computing environment that combines sophisticated computation, advanced graphics and visualization, and a high-level programming language.

# Learning Python
Research Computing offers an online "Introduction to Programming in Python" course. Click [here](https://learning.rc.virginia.edu/courses/python-introduction/) to start learning Python.

# Python on Rivanna
The default Python is required for system purposes and is generally too old for applications. We offer Python through the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) distribution from Continuum Analytics. Anaconda bundles a large number of popular modules and packages, as well as the Spyder IDE, an iPython console, and Jupyter notebooks. 

**View our [Anaconda on Rivanna](/userinfo/hpc/software/anaconda/) documentation for details.**
