# Overview
Python is an integrated technical computing environment that combines sophisticated computation, advanced graphics and visualization, and a high-level programming language.

# Learning Python
Research Computing offers an online "Introduction to Programming in Python" course. Click [here](https://learning.rc.virginia.edu/courses/python-introduction/) to start learning Python.

# Python on the HPC System
The default Python is required for system purposes and is generally too old for applications. We offer Python through the [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) distribution.

**View our [Miniforge on the HPC System](/userinfo/hpc/software/miniforge/) documentation for details.**
