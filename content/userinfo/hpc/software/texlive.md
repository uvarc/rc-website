# Add Local Package
We do not support user-requested packages in our module. If you need a package that is not included, please install it locally by following these instructions.

```
module load texlive
mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex
```

The directory structure of `~/texmf/tex/latex` should be the same as

```
ls $EBROOTTEXLIVE/texmf-dist/tex/latex
```

Each package should reside in its own directory. Create a subdirectory for your package under `~/texmf/tex/latex` and copy the `*.sty` file from ctan.org into the subdirectory. (If the package does not provide a `*.sty`, please follow the installation instructions. Typically, `latex *.dtx` or `latex *.ins` should produce the `*.sty` file.)

Then run:

```
$ texhash ~/texmf
texhash: Updating /home/mst3k/texmf/ls-R...
texhash: Done.
```

You should now be able to use the new package locally.
