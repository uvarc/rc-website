# Interactive Sessions through Open Ondemand

Interactive sessions of {{% software-name %}} can be launched through the HPC system's web portal, [Open OnDemand](/userinfo/hpc/ood).
To launch an instance of {{% software-name %}}, you will begin by connecting to our Open OnDemand portal. Your {{% software-name %}} session will run on a Rivanna/Afton GPU node. In addition, you need to specify required resources, e.g. time, your HPC allocation, etc. If you are new to HPC, you may want to read the [Getting Started Guide](/userinfo/hpc/#job-queues) to learn more about the partitions.

## Starting an Interactive Session
1. Open a web browser and go to URL:  https://ood.hpc.virginia.edu.
2. Use your Netbadge credentials to log in. This will open the Open OnDemand web portal.
3. On the top banner of the Open OnDemand dashboard, click on `Interactive Apps`.
4. In the drop-down box, click on `{{% software-name %}}`.
5. After connecting to {{% software-name %}} through Open OnDemand, a form will appear where you can fill in the resources for {{% software-name %}}. {{% software-name %}} supports GPUs and should be run in the `GPU` partition.
6. When done filling in the resources, click on the blue `Launch` button at the bottom of the form. **Do not click the button multiple times**.
7. It may take a few minutes for the system to gather the resources for your instance of {{% software-name %}}. When the resources are ready a `Launch {{% software-name %}}` button will appear. Click on the button to start {{% software-name %}}.


## Using {{% software-name %}}
When {{% software-name %}} opens in your web browser, it will appear just like the {{% software-name %}} that you have on your laptop or desktop.

## Closing the Interactive Session
When you are done, quit the {{% software-name %}} application. The interactive session will be closed and the allocated resources will be released.
