<br>
**Software Category:** {{% module-category %}}

For detailed information, visit the [{{% software-name %}} website]({{< module-homepage >}}).

# Available Versions
To find the available versions and learn how to load them, run:
```
module spider {{% module-name %}}
```

The output of the command shows the available {{% software-name %}} module versions.

For detailed information about a particular {{% software-name %}} module, including how to load the module, run the `module spider` command with the module's full version label. __For example__:

# Generate a key
To generate a key, execute the following command:
```
gpg --full-generate-key
```
and follow the on-screen instructions.

If it ends abruptly with this message:
```
gpg: agent_genkey failed: No pinentry
Key generation failed: No pinentry
```
please follow these steps:

1. Kill your current gpg-agent
```
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```
2. Start the agent with pinentry
```
gpg-agent --daemon --pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry
```
3. Run GnuPG
```
gpg --full-generate-key
```
It will ask you to “perform some other action” but just wait. After a few seconds you will be asked to create a passphrase in a popup window. Again, wait for a few seconds and retype your passphrase in another popup window. At the end you should see something like this:
```
gpg: /home/mst3k/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key **************** marked as ultimately trusted
gpg: directory '/home/mst3k/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d' created
gpg: revocation certificate stored as '/home/mst3k/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/***.rev'
public and secret key created and signed.
