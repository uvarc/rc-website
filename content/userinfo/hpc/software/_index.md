# Overview

Research Computing at UVA offers a variety of standard software packages for all UVA HPC users. We also install requested software based on the needs of the HPC community as a whole. Software used by a single group should be installed by that groupâ€™s members, ideally on leased storage controlled by the group. Departments with a set of widely-used software packages may install them to the lsp_apps space. The Research Computing group also provides limited assistance for individual installations.

For help installing research software on your PC, please contact Research Software Support at <a href="mailto:res-consult@virginia.edu">res-consult@virginia.edu</a>.

# Software Modules and Containers

Software on the HPC system is provided via environment [modules](/userinfo/hpc/software/modules) or as [containers](/userinfo/hpc/software/containers).
