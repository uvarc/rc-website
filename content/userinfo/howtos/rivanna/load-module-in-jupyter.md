Users cannot load modules inside a JupyterLab session. If you need access to modules, please request a [desktop session](https://ood.hpc.virginia.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/uva_desktop/session_contexts/new) instead of JupyterLab. Fill out the form as you normally would for JupyterLab. After you get to a desktop, open a terminal (next to Firefox in the top bar) and type these commands:

```
module load jupyterlab
module load ... # your modules here
jupyter-lab
```

This should start up Firefox shortly. If you accidentally close the window, right-click on the link in the terminal and choose "open link" to restart.

An example of using LaTeX inside a JupyterLab session is shown in the screenshot below.

**Note:** While you can load modules in the native terminal window within JupyterLab, it only applies to the terminal tab and has no effect on the notebook tab.
