<p class="lead">Lab Computing services are now available to research groups in the UVA School of Medicine to assist in providing the 
best in data storage for this specific environment.</a>

These services include:

# Data Migration & Storage

Assist in migration of data from legacy and non-managed data storage equipment to managed infrastructure storage on 
UVA Secured and Non-Secured networks. Ensure that labs, workers and managers have full access to their
data from all locations in a secure and stable environment.
	
Data storage options include:

* ES1 Data Storage
* ES3 Secured Data Storage
* Research Standard Storage (Option for Object Storage Backup)

# Training & Tools

Train researchers in the use of data storage migration and management tools. These tools are a combination of 
tested Open Source technologies and long-used tools.

These tools provide for:

* Synchronized and itemized data transfers for file syncs of live data
* Multithreaded rapid moves of data from Lab Storage to Managed Central Storage options
* Legacy platform data migration from older operating system platforms
* Data storage comparison to ensure all data copies have been tallied between multiple points

# Requirements & Consultation

As part of these services, we also provide an initial consultation to ensure that the data and laboratory requirements are met on
all levels. There is more to data migration than just uploading data.

Services may also include:	
	
* Retirement of outdated legacy equipment	
* Support the regular inventories of data, hardware and software
* Purchase and procurement of future storage options in line with long-term budgeting strategies

These resources help ensure that your lab data is protected and secured in compliance with ISPro, Grant and Security requirements,
and that your equipment, data management and software application needs are being met in a managed, professional manner.
