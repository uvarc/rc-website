      <b>Amazon S3</b> and <b>Glacier</b> offer cloud-based, affordable, unlimited capacity for storage from anywhere. Advanced
      features include scalability, lifecycle management, encryption, and sharing. S3 is ideal for static files that
      need to be retrieved from any location (PDFs, images, video, etc.). Glacier is archival storage, perfect for
      grant compliance that requires data retention.
