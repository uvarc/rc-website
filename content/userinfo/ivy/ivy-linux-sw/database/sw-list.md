The following database software are available on the Ivy Linux Virtual Machines

# MySQL

Is the most popular open-source relational database, used in academia and industry worldwide. It has been
in use for over 20 years and is backed by a large developer community. It is available in both free and 
proprietary versions. 

# MariaDB

MariaDB is a community developed version of MySQL, and is highly compatible with MySQL and other relational databases. Existing databases can be easily migrated between MySQL and MariaDB, and vice versa.

# PostgreSQL

Unlike MariaDB and MySQL, PostgreSQL is an *object relational* database, and can be used in a manner similar to other relational databases. It is available for free, and is open-source under its own special license type, called *PostgreSQL License*. 

# MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL, Document store database. It treats all data as key-value pair *documents*, stored within *collections*, instead of tables. MongoDB is great for large scale data processing needs.
