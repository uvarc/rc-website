# MATLAB Overview

MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates
computation, visualization, and programming environment. MATLAB stands for MATrix LABoratory. MATLAB was made
to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK (linear system package)
and EISPACK (Eigen system package) projects. MATLAB includes a programming language
environment with built-in editing and debugging tools, and supports object-oriented programming.

## Programming in MATLAB

MATLAB has many advantages compared to conventional computer languages (e.g.,
C, FORTRAN) for solving technical problems. MATLAB is an interactive system whose
basic data element is an array, and almost all problems can be solved in MATLAB using that
one data element.

### Starting MATLAB

To start MATLAB, open a terminal window and type ```matlab```

Since MATLAB is a large software, it may take time to load up. When it starts, the first screen to appear
would be the MATLAB Desktop, with several windows within it. These might include the ribbons (Home, Plot, and App), the Command Window,
the Current Folder window, and the Workspace window.

### Basic Arithmetic

The following are basic arithmetic operators in MARLAB
	* (Multiplication), + (Addition), - (Subtraction), / (Division)

In order to perform a simple calculation click anywhere on the Command Window and type

	1+2+3

and hit Enter/Return. the result shows up on the Command Window as ```Ans = 6```

### Variables

To create a variable, type the name of the variable, followed by the equals sign (assignment operator) and the value. Hit Enter/Return to store the value.

	x = 12

If you type ```x``` again on the Command Window, you would see the value of the variable displayed. Variables could be used in any number of arithmetic
calculations.

### Arrays

A very basic plot can be drawn using MATLAB arrays. To create an array in MATLAB, use the square brackets:

	x = [1 2 3 4 5 6]
	y = [4 -4 7 3 7 1]

Notice how the array elements do not have commas between them. These arrays could be used like any other variable.

## Licensing

University of Virginia has recently upgraded the Matlab license so that Matlab is available to everyone at UVa. There is one version of Matlab for students, faculty, and staff. MATLAB is available on the Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux platforms. To get started go to the UVa Software Gateway Matlab can be found under the Data Analysis & Research grouping.

The Campus Wide License configuration now includes all 100+ MathWorks products. To better reflect the new configuration they have re-named the license option to Campus Wide Suite.
