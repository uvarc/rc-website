# High Security VPN

The High Security VPN (HSVPN) allows researchers to connect to Ivy securely both on and off grounds. In order to use the HSVPN, users must ensure that their personal machines meet the following requirements. More information on HSVPN compliance can be found on the ITS website: <a href="https://in.virginia.edu/vpncheck" target="_blank">https://in.virginia.edu/vpncheck</a>

1. **Install the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.**
    This can be found at the <a href="https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=sg_catalog&sys_id=d66f4fd4db29274c2192e665059619d6&sysparm_category=06d7db5bdbfcab00cebc550a48961963" target="_blank">UVA ITS Software Gateway</a>. Be sure to install the version of VPN Client HS 4.6 that is compatible with your personal computer's operating system. More detailed instructions for installing the VPN client can be found on the <a href="https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=f24e5cdfdb3acb804f32fb671d9619d0" target="_blank">ITS website</a>.
    
2. **Install Opswat.**
    Opswat checks if your computer is compliant with HSVPN requirements. Opswat can be downloaded from the <a href="https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=sg_catalog&sys_id=a2bf4d91db716f402192e665059619fa" target="_blank">UVA ITS Software Gateway</a>.

{{% callout %}}
If your personal machine's operating system is no longer supported and does not allow for disk encryption, having OPSWAT installed will not resolve the issue. The recommended solution is to upgrade the operating system or acquire a device with an updated OS that meets these security requirements.
{{% /callout %}}


3. **Install Anti-malware software (Windows Defender recommended)**.
    Anti-malware software must be installed on your machine. Windows Defender is behavioral-based antimalware software and meets UVA's HSVPN requirements. Windows Defender can be downloaded from the <a href="https://virginia.service-now.com/its/?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=2bee0fd3dbc4a4d005fff49eae9619ee" target="_blank">UVA ITS Software Gateway</a>.
    

<!-- 
# Pricing

Ivy resources will be provided without a fee for approved projects. Please note that the pricing model is still under evaluation. A valid FDM is required as part of the account request process, although no charges will be made without advanced notice to the PI.

# Virtual Machines

A virtual machine (VM) is a computing instance dedicated to your project. Multiple users can sign in to a single VM.

Virtual machines come in two platforms, *Rocky 8 Linux* and *Windows Server 2019*. Each platform is available in numerous instance types. Refer to the grid below for specifics.


{{< pricing ivy >}}

Once created, your instance will be assigned a private IP address that you will use to connect to it (in the format `10.xx.xx.xx`). VMs exist in a private, secure network and cannot
reach outside resources on the Internet. Most inbound and outbound data transfer is managed through the Data Transfer Node (see below).


## Connecting to your VM

**Before connecting to your VM, you must run the High Security VPN. Make sure that you have the VPN client installed on your laptop/desktop.**

Next, you will need to know two pieces of information:
* The **type of VM** that you have, either Windows or Linux;
* The **IP address** of your VM (e.g., 10.xxx.xxx.xxx).

The steps for connecting to the VM will depend on the type of VM and, to a lesser extent, the operating system of your laptop/desktop (i.e., MacOS or Windows).

To connect to a Windows VM from a **Mac**, you will need the Microsoft Remote Destop application which you can  [download here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12) .  
Windows laptops/desktops already have the Remote Desktop Connection application installed.


### Steps to connect to your VM

Follow the steps below for the **type of VM** that you have:


<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2rem;">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-header">

      <div class="card-block">
        <ul>
          <li> Start the High Security VPN
          <li> Run the Remote Desktop application (see comment above for installing this application on Macs)
          <li> Enter the IP address for your VM
          <li> Sign in with your Eservices password and your computing ID prefixed by <em>ESERVICES</em> as the username (i.e. <code>ESERVICES\mst3k</code>)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-header">
        <b>Connecting to a Linux VM</b>
      </div>
      <div class="card-block">
        <ul>
          <li> Start the High Security VPN
          <li> Open a web browser and enter the IP address for your VM (e.g., https://10.xxx.xxx.xxx) 
          <li> If you get a warning message, you may need to click on Advanced Settings and/or a Connent Anyway option, depending on your web browser
          <li> Use your Netbadge credentials to log in
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

In addition to connecting to a Linux VM through a web browser, you have the option of connecting with an ssh client. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start the High Security VPN
2. Open the ssh client on your laptop/desktop (Terminal application on a Mac or Command Prompt on a Windows PC) and type:  `ssh mst3k@10.xxx.xxx.xxx`, where mst3k is replaced with your user ID.
3. When prompted for a password, use your Eservices password.





## Software

Every virtual machine (Linux or Windows) comes with a base installation of software by default. These help researchers by
providing the basic tools for data processing and manipulation. Additional software packages are pre-approved and available for installation
upon request. See the lists below for options.

### Preinstalled Software

## Installing Python Packages on Your VM

### Creating a Conda Environment

Researchers often require Python packages that are not included in the base installation of Anaconda. Users can install additional Python packages on their VMs using conda environments. Conda environments allows users to install packages in isolated environments to avoid version conflicts with other users on the VM.

#### Windows

1. Launch "Anaconda Prompt" from the Start Menu.

2. From the prompt, issue the command:

    `conda create -n my_env package1 package2`
    
    where `my_env` is the name you wish to give your new conda environment, and `package1` and `package2` are the names of the Python packages you want to install.
    
3. To activate and use your new environment, issue the command:

    `conda activate my_env`
    

#### Linux

1. Log into your VM via SSH or log in through your web browser and launch the Terminal.

2. From the prompt, issue the command:

    `conda create -n my_env package1 package2`
    
    where `my_env` is the name you wish to give your new conda environment, and `package1` and `package2` are the names of the Python packages you want to install.
    
3. To activate and use your new environment, issue the command:

    `conda activate my_env`
    
#### Creating a Conda Environment with a Specific Python Version

If you require a specific version of Python, you can create a new conda environment with:

`conda create -n my_env python=2.7`

### Installing Packages

After creating your conda environment, you can install additional libraries with `pip` and `conda`.

#### Installing Packages with `pip`

* Use `pip` from the command line to install individual packages:

    `pip install numpy`

* You can search for a package:

     `pip search panda`
     
* To see which packages you have installed already:

    `pip list`
    
* You can install packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file (one package per line): 

    `pip -r requirements.txt`
    
* To save a list of your currently installed packages in a `requirements.txt` file:

    `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
    
#### Installing packages with `conda`

`conda` works similarly to `pip`.

* To install a package:

    `conda install scipy`
    
* To search for a package:

    `conda search scipy`
    
* And to list all packages in your environment:

    `conda list`
    
Once installed on your VM, packages will persist and you will not need to install them again. You will only need to import them again in your code.

## Storage

Ivy VM has a pool of over 2 petabytes of Network Attached Storage shared amongst users. A PI specifies the storage space s/he would like to have when requesting access to Ivy. Virtual machines do not come with any significant disk storage of their own.  
## Scheduled Maintenance

Beginning Sunday, April 14, your Ivy virtual machine (VM) will be rebooted on the 2nd Sunday of each month between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. EST while RC engineers install security updates. Any sessions running during this period will be terminated. Windows and Linux VMs will be rebooted at the same time.

If you have any questions or problems with your software applications after the security updates have been installed, you may [contact our user services team](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/form/support-request/?category=Ivy).

# Data Transfer In/Out of Ivy {#data-transfer-in-out-of-ivy}

Moving sensitive data into the Ivy VMware platform is possible through a secure Globus DTN (data transfer node). The Ivy DTN is connected to a pool of secure storage called “High-Security Research Standard Storage”, which in turn is connected to Ivy VMs. Only active research projects using Ivy virtual machines can use this service.

<img style="max-width:100%;" alt="Ivy Secure DTN Flow" src="/images/ivy-dtn-flow.png" />

## How to Connect to the DTN and Transfer Files

Before transferring files to Ivy, you will need Globus installed on the computer you are transferring data from. Globus can be downloaded from [https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal).

1. Ensure that you are **NOT** connected to the HSVPN. Data transfer will not work if you are connected to the HSVPN.

2. Open Globus in your web browser: [https://app.globus.org/file-manager](https://app.globus.org/file-manager). When logging in, select **University of Virginia** and log in with Netbadge.

3. Once you are in the Globus **File Manager**, select the two-panel view by clicking the two-panel button beside the **Panels** button in the top-right corner of the page. This should open a second panel on the page, so that you have two side by side.

4. In one panel, click on the **Collections** field and select your computer. You can then click to the directory that contains the data you want to move, or type the path to the directory in the **Path** field. Click the files or folders you want to transfer to select them.

5. In the remaining panel, click on the **Collections** field and search for and select the **UVA IVY-DTN**. Select the storage share to which you want to transfer data. (Unless you are part of multiple Ivy projects, you should only see one storage folder.)

6. Click the **Start** button beneath the first panel (should be highlighted) to begin the data transfer.

7. Once the data transfer is complete, you will be able to access the data in your VM by clicking the **High-Security Research Standard Storage** shortcut on your VM's desktop.

# HIPAA Compliance

The Ivy platform is HIPAA-compliant by design. From the <a href="https://research.virginia.edu/irb-hsr/protected-health-information-hipaa-regulations-and-research" target="_new">UVA Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research</a> (IRB-HSR):

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
<p>HIPAA affects only that research which uses, creates, or discloses PHI. Researchers have legitimate needs to use, access, and disclose PHI to carry out a wide range of health research studies.</p>
<p>The Privacy Rule protects PHI while providing ways for researchers to access and use PHI when necessary to conduct research.</p>
<p>In general, there are two types of human research that would involve PHI:</p>

<ul>
<li>Studies involving review of existing medical records as a source of research information. Retrospective studies, such as chart reviews, often do this. Sometimes prospective studies do it also, for example, when they contact a participant's physician to obtain or verify some aspect of the participant's health history.
<li>Studies that create new medical information because a health care service is being performed as part of the research, such as testing of a new way of diagnosing a health condition or a new drug or device for treating a health condition. Virtually all sponsored clinical trials that submit data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will involve PHI.
</ul>

</div>

Researchers must understand that, in general, the more difficult parts of HIPAA compliance are less technical (networks, computers, and data) than they are human and how users interact with these systems and data. The mishandling of data -- such as storing them on insecure devices or in insecure places -- jeopardizes confidential patient data and UVA's ability to remain a trusted keeper of those data.

All data imported into Ivy must be treated as highly sensitive data. Data and results exported from Ivy must be protected 
and managed appropriately according to UVA's [data classification 
guidelines](https://security.virginia.edu/university-data-protection-standards). Guidance regarding these guidelines and 
data types is available from UVA Information Security, Policy, and Records Office (ISPRO) by emailing 
[it-security@virginia.edu](mailto:it-security@virginia.edu).
