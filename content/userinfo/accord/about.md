# What is it

ACCORD (Assuring Controls Compliance of Research Data) gives researchers from different colleges and universities access to a single high-performance computing system capable of processing and storing sensitive data, such as confidential medical information. This is especially important for schools that lack the financial, staffing, or technical resources for such systems. ACCORD is designed to encourage collaborative research partnerships across institutions by managing the risks associated with sensitive data sharing.

ACCORD is project-based, which means that investigators request access
to the platform, create a project and populate it with co-investigators,
import data, and then create and use disposable computing environments
to perform their computational research.


# Who can use it


This platform is open for approved academic research on highly sensitive data. Researchers from
institutions of higher education across the United States are invited to request access.

ACCORD is appropriate for de-identified PII (personally identifiable information), FERPA, and other types of sensitive data. More
restrictive levels, such as CUI, FISMA, PCI cannot be satisfied.


# How do I use it


ACCORD is entirely web-based, which means it can be easily accessed using a modern browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari. Once you have created a project in ACCORD, you will use the
ACCORD Console login and select from one of the applications. Currently we offer RStudio, JupyterLab, and Theia Python. More detailed information can be found in our [User Guide](https://accord-docs.uvarc.io/user-guide.html)

ACCORD offers no SSH, FTP, Remote Desktop, or VNC access.



# Who runs it


The ACCORD project was developed by the [Research Computing Group](https://www.rc.virginia.edu) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), under the coordination of the ACCORD Grant Program Manager
[Tho Nguyen](https://vpit.virginia.edu/tho) and [Ron Hutchins](https://vpit.virginia.edu/), Vice Provost of Academic Technology.
