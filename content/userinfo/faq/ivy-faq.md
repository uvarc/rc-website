# General Usage

## What are Ivy and Rio?
Ivy and Rio are located in Research Computing’s high-security environment, allowing researchers to compute and store highly sensitive data. Ivy refers to isolated Virtual Machines (VMs) that are provisioned per requested project. Rio refers to a high-performance computing cluster that is usable within the high security environment.

## How do I gain access to Ivy/Rio?
Access is granted and managed at the project level. PIs may request a new project by filling out our [Project Request Form](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/ivy/#requesting-access). PIs can add new members or remove members to existing projects via the [Ivy Services Application](https://services.rc.virginia.edu/).

## Who is eligible to request a project?
All UVA faculty are eligible to serve as PI and request access to Ivy and Rio for their research group. Staff and students are not eligible to serve as PI.

## How do I manage the members of my project?
User access is granted through a project’s individual page within our [Ivy Services Application](https://services.rc.virginia.edu/). The PI will have an option to add and remove members. The PI will also need to verify membership status annually. 

## My PI wants to add me to their project. What do I need to do?
When you are added to a project, you will receive an email to review and sign the Research Use Data Agreement (RUDA), which outlines the policies and procedures required to maintain the integrity and security of the environment. Alongside this, you need to complete the following:

* Complete the High Security Awareness Training (HSAT). This training needs to be completed annually. 
* Set up your workstation for access to the High Security VPN (HSVPN) by installing:
  * [Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client](https://in.virginia.edu/vpn)
  * [Opswat](https://in.virginia.edu/vpncheck)
  * [ITS-configured anti-malware software](https://in.virginia.edu/mde)

Note: You do not need to request an HSVPN filter. Our team submits the request when provisioning you as a new user. 

## Can I access the Internet from my VM?
VMs run on a private, secure network and cannot reach outside Internet sources by default. PIs may request access to specific sites required for the project, subject to a security review by our team by submitting an [Ivy support ticket](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/form/support-request/). We cannot guarantee that all domains can be accessed.
