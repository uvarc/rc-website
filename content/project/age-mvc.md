Previous research has shown that older adults are more susceptible to severe injury than their younger counterparts after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. Dr. Hartka was interested in determining whether there are age-related differences in the accuracy of severe injury prediction following a motor vehicle collision. Using R, Research Computing developed age-specific logistic regression models and assessed their accuracy, and generated unique graphs and animations to visualize the data more effectively.
