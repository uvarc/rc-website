The Computing Hardware Research Lab (CHRL) worked with the DAC to develop a pipeline connecting a web app to HPC resources for solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems such as computing the MaxCut in complex graphs using OmegaSync. The DAC created an RShiny app running on Kubernetes that collects user information and graph files. The app formats data, saves it to the HPC filesystem, and automates job submissions. It also triggers email notifications to users upon job start and completion, providing the results they need. This project highlights the DAC's role in supporting faculty with complex research workflows.
