A powerful new technique for quantifying regions of the cerebral cortex was developed by Nick Tustison and James Stone at the University of Virginia along with collaborators from the University of Pennsylvania. It was evaluated using large data sets comprised of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human brain processed on a high-performance computing cluster at the University of Virginia.  By making this technique available as open-source software, other neuroscientists are now able to investigate various hypotheses concerning the relationship between brain structure and development. Tustison’s and Stone’s software has been widely disseminated and is being actively incorporated into a variety of clinical research studies, including a collaborative effort between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs, exploring the long term effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among military service members.
