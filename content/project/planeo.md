The Planetary Child Health and Enterics Observatory (Plan-EO) is an interdisciplinary research initiative at UVA.  Its mission is to provide researchers and public health stakeholders with diverse spatial data tools for the geographical targeting of enteropathogen-specific child health interventions. The DAC collaborated with the Plan-EO team to provide secure computational resources through the Ivy secure environment to support their analyses, development of a data workflow pipeline, and to identify a hosting solution for an interactive, cloud-based geospatial dashboard.
