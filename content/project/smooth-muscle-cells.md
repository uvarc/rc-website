Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed more than 50 genomic loci that are associated with increased risk for CAD. However, the pathological mechanisms for the majority of the GWAS loci leading to increased susceptibility to this complex disorder are still unclear. RC is working with Redouane Aherrahrou (CPHG) who aims to study the impact of the CAD-associated genetic factors on the cellular and molecular SMC phenotypes. Support for this project has included preparation of scripts for programmatic data analyses, data visualization, statistical modeling, and assistance with use of the Rivanna high-performance computing cluster.

*Preliminary results were presented as a poster at the 2016 International Vascular Biology Meeting.*
