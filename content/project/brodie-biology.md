Ed Hall worked with the Brodie Lab in the Biology department, to set up a workflow to analyze videos of bug tracking experiments on the Rivanna Linux cluster. They wanted to use the community Matlab software (idTracker) for beetle movement tracking. Their two goals were to shorten the software runtime and to automate the process. There was a large backlog of videos to go through. Ed installed the idTracker software on Rivanna and modified the code to parallelize the bug tracking process. He wrote and documented shell scripts to automate their workflow on the cluster.
