This proposal is to enhance the computational analysis of calcium imaging data from live adrenal tissue in the study of primary aldosteronism, a leading cause of hypertension. The significant computational challenges associated with large calcium imaging datasets and complex analyses are addressed by first improving the current workflow for greater efficiency and accessibility, and second, establishing a robust computaional workflow and data management strategy.
