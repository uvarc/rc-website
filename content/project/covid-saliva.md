In cooperation with the UVA Saliva Testing Lab, the UVA Health System, and the Virginia Department of Health, the "Be SAFE" saliva
testing program was launched in late 2020. Be SAFE uses saliva samples to detect the COVID-19 virus through a diagnostic PCR test.

Research Computing provided computational, storage, and data integration expertise to this project.
