UVA Research Computing worked with researchers in the UVA [Center for Behavioral Health and Technology](https://med.virginia.edu/bht/) to move many of its web-based research instruments to the cloud. 

CBHT "*has been involved in eHealth, specifically the development and testing of clinical interventions delivered via the Internet.  We believe the Internet can be used to implement engaging, interactive, and comprehensive interventions.  Our interventions are designed to improve outcome by tailoring the programs to the individual user.  We were among the first to test the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering Internet interventions.*" Their research depends upon secure, data-driven websites that both enable participants to make regular submissions via web form, but also to safeguard private health data for researchers to learn from.

When their previous generation of hardware was ready to be retired, CBHT developers contacted Research Computing to help redesign their platform and plan their migration into the Amazon public cloud. Their setup includes private, encrypted databases and web servers, and a strictly-controlled environment for highly sensitive data.
